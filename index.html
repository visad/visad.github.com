        <h3>Welcome to VisAD on GitHub!</h3>

<p>VisAD is a Java component library for interactive and collaborative
visualization and analysis of numerical data.  The name VisAD is
an acronym for
<em><span style="color: red">Vis</span>ualization for
<span style="color: red">A</span>lgorithm
<span style="color: red">D</span>evelopment</em>.
The system combines:</p>

<ul>
<li>The use of pure Java for platform independence and to support data sharing
    and real-time collaboration among geographically distributed users.  Support
    for distributed computing is integrated at the lowest levels of the system
    using Java RMI distributed objects.</li>
<li>A general mathematical data model that can be adapted to virtually any
    numerical data, that supports data sharing among different users, different
    data sources and different scientific disciplines, and that provides
    transparent access to data independent of storage format and location (i.e.,
    memory, disk or remote).  The data model has been adapted to netCDF, HDF-5,
    FITS, HDF-EOS, McIDAS, Vis5D, and many other file formats.</li>
<li>A general display model that supports interactive 3-D, data fusion,
    multiple data views, direct manipulation, collaboration, and virtual
    reality.  The display model has been adapted to Java3D and Java2D
    and used in an ImmersaDesk virtual reality display.</li>
<li>Data analysis and computation integrated with visualization to support
    computational steering and other complex interaction modes.</li>
<li>Support for two distinct communities: developers who create domain-
    specific systems based on VisAD, and users of those domain-specific systems.
    VisAD is designed to support a wide variety of user interfaces, ranging from
    simple data browser applets to complex applications that allow groups of
    scientists to collaboratively develop data analysis algorithms.</li>
<li>Developer extensibility in as many ways as possible.
</ul>
